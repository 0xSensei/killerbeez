test.c is just a very simple testcase to make sure our instrumentation is
working as expected.  It looks at the first 4 characters of input, and takes a
different one for each character matching "ABCD".  If the full string matches
ABCD, then the test program will crash (by writing to NULL).

In the compiled test.exe executable, the main function is at offset 0x1000
(0x401000 address).
