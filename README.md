Killerbeez is a fuzzing framework which aims to bring together as many of the
awesome tools out there as possible into a standard format.  The goal is not
just to get them to work with this project, but ideally each other as well,
which can be accomplished by writing things to a common API.  As a side effect,
it means writing cross-platform tools should be easier as well on account of
encouraging clean interfaces which inherently discourages spaghetti code.

Documentation can be found in the docs folder.  It's written in LaTeX which
can be used to generate a PDF, HTML, or various other formats.  PDFs are also
included so the documentation is easy to read for those who do not have a LaTeX
typesetting environment set up.
