In addition to the fuzzer, a few utilities have been created that help with the
fuzzing process.  This section describes these helper utilities and their role
in the \killerbeez{} architecture.

\subsection{Merger}
The merger combines multiple sets of instrumentation data into one
instrumentation state.  The resulting instrumentation state will include the
tracked coverage from all of the input instrumentation states. This allows
multiple instances of the fuzzer to share instrumentation data, and ignore paths
that the other fuzzers found.

\subsection{Picker}
The picker helps the user decide which libraries should be instrumented while
fuzzing.  This is accomplished by running the target program and recording
coverage information on each of the loaded libraries. It then analyzes the
coverage information for each library to determine which libraries the
coverage information varies based on the input file.  These libraries are most
likely the ones that process the input file, and thus the most likely targets
for fuzzing.
