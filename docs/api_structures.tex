This section describes the structures used throughout the API.  For each of the
top level components, there is a structure which defines the available functions
in that component.  This allows for a common interface among all of the
available implementations of a component.

\vbox{\lstinputlisting[
  label={lst:mutatort},
  caption={\texttt{mutator\_t} struct definition},
  language=C,
  captionpos=b
  ]{files/mutator_t.c}
}

The \texttt{mutator\_t} structure, shown in Listing \ref{lst:mutatort}, defines
all of the common interfaces for each mutator.  The definitions of each of the
function pointers in the \texttt{mutator\_t} structure is described in Section
\ref{mutator}.
