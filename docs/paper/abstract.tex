\textbf{\textit{Abstract}}:
The trend of people increasingly relying on software has continued for
several decades and shows no sign of abating. Businesses rely on Windows and
the applications which run on it, servers are typically some type of UNIX
system, and Apple computers are gaining popularity as of late. The desire
for these systems to be stable and resilient to attacks drives the need to find
software errors which may compromise them. Many improvements have been
made in the field of software testing, with one of the popular ones being fuzz
testing, or fuzzing for short.  Unfortunately the implementation details make
it difficult to compare or combine different methods, while others are only
available for specific operating systems, or limited to cases where source
code is available.  Killerbeez intends to pull these technologies together
and allow them to interoperate. It is scalable, supports multiple operating
systems, is extensible, and will have support for testing both kernel and
user space applications. Killerbeez's goal is to measure the effectiveness
of various fuzzing techniques in a variety of situations so the optimal
solution can be applied.
