In this paper, we present Killerbeez, a fuzzing framework that integrates many
disparate research projects so that they can be used together. This framework
allows for independent fuzzing improvements to be reused in a distributed,
cross-platform way that they otherwise would not have been able to. Furthermore,
Killerbeez allows for each new improvement to be easily evaluated against the
existing components, which will expedite the evaluation of new research.  The
authors have released killerbeez as open-source
software\footnote{https://github.com/grimm-co/killerbeez} in the hopes that it
will allow for the quicker adoption and evaluation of new security research,
resulting in a more efficient vulnerability detecting system.
