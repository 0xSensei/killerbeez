Over the past few years, coverage-guided fuzzing has become a popular way to
find software and hardware vulnerabilities due to advances in publicly
available tools such as AFL\cite{afl} and its derivatives.\cite{vanhauser} Many
fuzzers track bugs which were found with their tools in ``trophy cases'' which
demonstrate their effectiveness against real world application.  However, most
tools are primarily focused on finding bugs in open source, command line Linux
software which reads input from files or standard input. There has been some
exploration to get AFL working on other operating
systems\cite{aflosx}\cite{winafl} as well as supporting network
input.\cite{netafl}\cite{preeny}

Most of the published improvements over the original version of AFL are
implemented as forks of
AFL.\cite{aflfast}\cite{aflgo}\cite{fairfuzz}\cite{perffuzz}\cite{pythia}\cite{collafl}
Thus the enhancements are mutually exclusive, short of embarking on a
development effort to go through the modifications and merge the forks back
together, manually resolving any conflicts and incompatibilities.

We present Killerbeez, a fuzzing framework which brings together many of the
various security analysis tools so they can be used together.  The code
compiles on multiple operating systems, can handle target applications with or
without source code, software with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Furthermore, the input mutation algorithms, instrumentation, seed selection
algorithms, and methods for feeding input data to the target are all easily
interchangeable.  This enables two things (1) easily mixing and matching
tactics from different researchers, and (2) implementing new algorithms easily.
Finally, Killerbeez is scalable, using BOINC\cite{boinc} to distribute work to
multiple nodes from a central server.

Our contributions include:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item An API combining the different components of a fuzzer in a pluggable way
\item A collection of existing fuzzers ported to the API
\item A method for automatically determining which libraries are likely to
	cause a crash, and focusing on those
\end{enumerate}
