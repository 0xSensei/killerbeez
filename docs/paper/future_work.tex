% Unsolved problems:

% How to choose targets
% How to generate seeds
%   Give shout out to JRozner with his project & DEF CON talk
% Where to get seeds?
%   Search the web, very ad-hoc and manual process
% Avoiding the easy-to-find crashes to get to the more interesting ones
%   Could be done with smarter input generators/mutators & automated static/dynamic analysis
% Targets which include checksums, compression or encryption
%   Typical solution, modify the source/executable to remove those checks


% Room for improvement:

% Detecting non-crashing errors (especially without source code for the target)
