% TODO: Make sure we are consistent with our capitalization.  E.g. if we're
%       going to make Driver a proper noun so it is clear that we're talking
%       about it in our domain specific definition, we need to do so
%       consistently.  If not, we need to consistently spell it with a lower
%       case "d"
% TODO: We should be saying seed inputs, not seed files.
% TODO: We should be saying executable instead of binary.
% TODO: Maybe it's be better to refer to the target software instead of target
%       application. Saying "application" is confusing when using Killerbeez to
%       do kernel fuzzing; software covered both cases
% TODO: Remove most/all instances of first person voice (we, us, our, etc.)
% TODO: Ensure all acronyms we use are expanded on first use

% The overview describes what components exist (driver, mutator, manager, etc.)
% and why. Examples are provided as needed, but just enough to cover the
% concepts.
\section{Killerbeez Overview} \label{Killerbeez Overview}
\input{overview}

% The implementation goes over each component in detail to showcase what we
% have available so far.

% This is where we cover planned expansions, both in terms of additional things
% to pull in, such as grammars which generate test files, Driller style
% integration of symbolic execution, and additional modules for the existing
% components (drivers, instrumentation, etc.).
